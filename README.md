# Y-charger
Wirelessly transferring power.
Abstract:
Y-charger is project aiming to achieve wireless power transfer to a more distance over the air. Magnetic resonace coupling is the key concept that has been used in making the device. The ultimate aim is to create the device which follows the QI(chei) standrads and can communicate with the reciever circuitory as well smartly control the power flow and minimising the losses. We are using litz wire for coils which minimises the skin effect. A invertor circuit powers the whole system. For processing and controlling action micro-controller is used both transmitter and reciever side.
