# Y-charger
Wirelessly transferring power.
## Abstract:
Y-charger is a project aiming to achieve wireless power transfer to a more distance over the air. Magnetic resonance coupling is the key concept that has been used in making the device. The ultimate aim is to create a tool which follows the QI(chi) standards. It can communicate with the receiver circuitry as well as smartly control the power flow, minimising the losses. We use Litz wire for coils which reduces the skin effect. An inverter circuit powers the whole system. For processing and controlling, action micro-controller is used both on the transmitting and the receiving end.
