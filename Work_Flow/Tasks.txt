1. Inverter
    1. need to decide wich type of inverter need to be designed(PQR/SQR/ModSQR)
        In case of PQR:
            1. topology
    2. then simulation
    3. fabrication on perfboard

2. Transmitter side Controller
    Tasks of Controller:
        inverter:
            1. inrush current prevention (not applicable for this particular application)
            2. current and voltage safety limits
            3. voltage regulation
            4. maximum power tracking ( resonance frequency tracking )
            5. combining Controller with inverter 
        
        for communication:
            1. QI communication
            2. foreign object and target detection
            
3. Transmitter and Receiver circuit:
    1. Theoretical model explaning the variation of different parameters(ex. efficiency, power transfer) with the circuital parameters.
    2. deciding optimum frequency, and circuital parameters, size, shape and inductance of the coil  
    3. simulation
    4. making transmitter and receiver coil and fabrication

    then combining it with the inverter circuit

4. rectifier and buck-boost converter intergration

5. Receiver side Controller
    1. current and voltage monitoring circuit
    2. communication QI protocol

**yet to decide the priority for the given Tasks

priority order of the tasks:
