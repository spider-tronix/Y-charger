simulation findings:
    1. Rectifier can act as circuit isolator. The resonant frequency will not be affected by the circuit after the rectifier.
    2. parallel resonator on receiver side will be hard to model(according to me) and also frequency splitting phenomenon will occur. 
    but in series resonator, resonator frequency spiltting doesn't occur.
    ### Major disadvantage in seriss resonace is that the voltage produced across the resistor is very small and also the current. But In case of parallel resonace, the power transferred is significant.
